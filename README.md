Game created for the 2022 game jam I participated in. This is the code as is, haven't touched it since the jam. Fell free to use it as you see fit, learn from it, or whatever you want. Made in Unity.

This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2022 for a very small amount of time, around 24, so it is very buggy and bare bones, but the main idea is kinda there. Sadly didn't manage to add any kind of sound or music.
