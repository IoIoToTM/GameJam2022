Hey there. <size=0.2> (press Space to continue)
You can start moving me with the wasd keys.
Try and explore around, but whatever you do, DO NOT TOUCH THAT BUTTON...

[title=2_start]
OH NO!! WHAT DID YOU DO???? 
Now we have to go through a very simple puzzle to fix this mess.
(I wonder what would happen if I jump into the hole)

[title=3_start]
Whoaaaa, I'm outside the game world....
This is so trippy....
OH WAIT, it says something on the back of the window...
<size=0.2> press R to rotate window....?
Why don't you try that?
[title=3_end]

[title=4_start]
Ohhh try pressing the button as well, let's see what happens

[title=5_start]
Coloured glass? Hmmm....
Maybe it can show something hidden around the desktop, try dragging it and searching around.
[title=5_end]


[title=6_start]
A button!!! I think that should fix everything
Let's press it!
[title=6_end]


[title=7_start]
Well.... I guess this is alright... not really completely fixed...
This is probably a cliffhanger for a sequel where it actually gets fixed completely.
So... I think this is the end of the game, so you can press V to close (why V...).
